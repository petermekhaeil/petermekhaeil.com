Not only do interviews open doors to new opportunities, they also help you sharpen your skills with new learnings. Interviews keep your career moving forward and I will share some learnings you will come across.

## You will learn about what you know

You will have the opportunity to share your past experiences followed by questions for the interviewer to understand more about those experiences. When you answer those questions, you will learn to what level you understand the topics being discussed.

Speaking out loud about what you know helps you articulate those past career learnings and experiences. With each interview, the more you will be asked similar questions and the more you will improve your confidence in talking about what you know.

## You will learn about what you do not know yet

You will be asked questions you do not know the answer to and that is totally fine - this will be an opportunity to learn something new! Ask the interviewer for the answers to those questions. Now whether or not you decide to continue with the interview rounds, you have now learnt something new that you can take to your existing job or you take to your next interview. With each interview, you are building up your knowledge base.

## You will learn to negotiate

When you get to the offer stage of the interviews, you will learn about your worth to the company and how it compares to your existing job. It will be an opportunity for you to practice negotiation, a very handy skill to have at any level in your career. With each interview, you will sharp your negotiation skills and pick up experience in handling those situations.

_A great book on this topic is [The Coding Career Handbook](https://learninpublic.org/) - a chapter is dedicated to salary negotiation where youâ€™ll learn that you have an upper hand simply because the best alternative is staying at the job you already have._

## That is not all you will learn

Each person will have their own experience and each person will have a different learning. With each interview, you will be practicing a useful skill for your career, such as building your confidence, expanding your knowledge and salary negotiating.
