One of the most fulfilling habits I've developed throughout my career is maintaining a "Today I Learned" (TIL) list. What started as a casual way to jot down things I didn’t want to forget has grown into a powerful tool for learning, reflection, and collaboration.

## Why TIL?

It all started with the realization that I was learning something new every day, but often these lessons would fade as quickly as they came. Whether it was solving a coding problem, uncovering a technical insight during a discussion, or learning from a mistake, I wanted a way to capture these moments.

So, I began documenting them. Over time, this habit evolved into my TIL list, a structured way to track and reflect on my growth.

## Inspired by "Learn in Public"

The idea of TIL is closely tied to the concept of [Learn in Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) popularized by Shawn Wang (aka Swyx). The principle is simple: share your learning journey openly so others can benefit from your experiences. This approach not only reinforces your own understanding but also invites collaboration and feedback from the community.

By embracing "Learn in Public," my TIL list became more than just a personal tool. It turned into a way to give back, spark discussions, and connect with others who share similar interests.

## Turning a Habit into a System

Consistency is key to making any habit stick. To ensure I didn’t lose momentum, I built a system around TIL:

1. **Daily Capture**: Each day, I aim to record at least one key takeaway. It could come from debugging, reading, or collaborating with others.

2. **Automating Reminders**: I set up tools like calendar alerts to remind me to add new entries. These small nudges keep me on track.

3. **Periodic Reflection**: Regular reviews of my TIL entries help me reinforce past learnings and spot areas for deeper exploration.

This structured approach has kept the practice alive and valuable.

## Broadening the Scope

While my TILs are currently focused on technical insights, the beauty of this habit is its flexibility. It doesn’t have to be limited to coding or development topics. You can capture learnings from any area—leadership lessons, communication strategies, process improvements, or even personal hobbies. The key is to document anything that adds value to your growth and understanding.

If you’re starting a TIL list, think broadly. Reflect on all aspects of your day-to-day experiences. Did you learn something new about managing a team? Did a conversation provide a fresh perspective? These moments are just as valuable as technical insights and deserve a place in your list.

## Organizing for the Long Haul

As your TIL list grows, having a structure can make it more useful. Here’s an example of a format you might use:

| Date | Title | Description | Category |
|---|---|---|---|
|   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |

This format can help you quickly search and revisit specific learnings. You could also add categories like "Technical",  "Leadership" or "Communicaiton" to make your list even more navigable.

## Sharing and Collaborating

One of the most unexpected benefits of TIL has been its impact on collaboration. Sharing my TILs—whether in team meetings, blog posts, or discussions—has:

- Sparked conversations and new ideas.
- Helped others solve similar problems.
- Encouraged teammates to start their own TIL lists.

By "Learning in Public", I’ve seen how sharing knowledge can amplify its value.

## Why You Should Start a TIL List

Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned expert, starting a TIL list can transform your approach to learning. Here’s why:

1. **Build Confidence**: Seeing your list grow over time is a great reminder of how much you’ve learned.
2. **Give Back**: Sharing your learnings online might help someone else solve a problem they’re facing.
3. **Stay Curious**: TILs make you more attuned to new opportunities to learn.

If you’re new to the idea, start small. You don’t need to publish your list right away—even a private journal can work wonders. But if you’re comfortable, take the plunge and share your learnings with the world. You might be surprised at the connections and conversations that follow.

## Wrapping Up

Maintaining a TIL list has transformed the way I approach learning and growth. It’s a habit that has not only deepened my understanding but also connected me with others in meaningful ways.
